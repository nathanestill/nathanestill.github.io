## Robotics Engineering, Class of 2021
I'm a student at the Olin College of Engineering. This portfolio shows many of my projects at Olin College of Engineering.

### [Swarm Simulation](https://jzerez.github.io/swarms/writeups/mainpage/main) December 2020
In this project, we set out to create a simulated decentralized robot swarm that would exhibit self-assembling properties. Specifically, we wanted to replicate morphogenesis, the process by which cells are able to self-organize themselves in order to form complex tissues and organs through local interactions alone. This is of great interest to us, as decentralized systems are full of complexity, and are quite different from centralized robotic systems. Decentralized swarms offer a number of really cool advantages in that they are very robust to external noise, damage to a number of individual agents within the swarm, and unpredictable variations in the environment.

### [Sign Detection](https://github.com/aramachandran7/computer_vision/blob/main/writeup.md) November 2020
The goal of our project was to implement a robot controller capable of responding to street signs in the near vicinity by detecting the sign and passing on that information to a robot, for the robot to react to the sign based on its type. We ran into a couple unforeseen roadbumps along the way, and ended with a final MVP of a project capable of recognizing a stop sign and stopping the motion of a car upon approaching the stop sign at a certain distance.

### [Robot Localization](https://github.com/jzerez/robot_localization) October 2020
The goal of the project was to implement a particle filter in order to localize a robot within a known map.

### [Protothreading in C on the Arduino Uno](https://github.com/amfry/SoftSysUnravel/blob/master/Reports/report.md) May 2019
Our project goal is to create a program that can run multiple threads on an Arduino Uno. Our minimum goal was to understand how protothreading works and have a small program that utilizes multi-threading to make two things update simultaneously on an Arduino. We decided to implement our protothreads in the context of creating a simple bike light. Our bike light was made up of 3 LEDs that could be toggled through with a button.

### [Shell Implementation in C](https://github.com/nathanestill/SoftSysHalfShell/blob/master/reports/report.md) April 2019
The goal of our project is to simulate a UNIX shell. Our MVP is to create a shell that contains five commands that the user can use. Our stretch goal is to get our shell as close to the UNIX command line as we can.

### [Programmable Instrument Experience](http://poe.olin.edu/2018/the_nevers/) October-December 2018
Our goal is to create a unique and enjoyable musical instrument. We hope to engineer an intricate and immersive performance experience that allows users to create a host of unusual sounds, even simultaneously.

### [Map Navigation With Turtlebot 2](https://amyphung.github.io/SLAM-SoftDes-Final-Project/) April-May 2018
We made a program that allows a robot to navigate a known map effectively. We got a map of the third floor of the Campus Center at Olin College by running a Turtlebot around the space and receiving LIDAR data from a Kinect. From there we selected a goal for the simulated robot to go to and our program calculated the best path for the robot to take. Then we gave the robot instructions on how to navigate the map to get to the goal.

### [Asteroids in Pygame](https://github.com/coreyacl/InteractiveProgramming/blob/master/ProjectReflection.md) March 2018
We created a Pygame version of the classic arcade game, Asteroids.
